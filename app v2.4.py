# Description: This is a PySimpleGUI-based Python software tool for processing and visualising selected Windows Event
#              Security.evtx log files.
# Updates: * Revision v2.4.
#          * Added total number of events that meet condition in histogram to be shown in title.
#          * Added more spacing between the histogram's bars if more occurrences are found.
#          * Some non app breaking text typos are corrected and verbiage edited for clarity.
#          * Timestamp labels on the x-axis are visually clearer to read now since I have repositioned the ticks.
#          * The histogram colour was changed to green to match the colour scheme of the software tool aesthetically.
#          * The histogram window created by matplotlib is now larger for visually clarity and readability.
#          * The PySimpleGUI window is now larger to accommodate for visual clarity and aesthetics.
#          * Confirmed to be compatible with older Python3 interpreters [my script is written in Python3].
# Limitations:
#              * With larger log files such as the Securityv2.evtx log file that I supplied it takes longer to process,
#              but, this is expected.
#              * No end-user authentication implemented to provide a layer of security.
#              * The software tool does indeed notify the end-user, however, it would be a nice quality-of-life firmware
#              update if they were emailed or messaged the outcome which may be useful in an enterprise when log files
#              are much larger and could take a considerable amount of time to process. Possibly using Slack's API.
